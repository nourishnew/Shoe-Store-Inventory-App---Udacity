# The Shoe Store

This project will consist of five screens. You don't have to create a shoe store, you can use any other item as long as you create the following screens. You will be creating:

1. Login screen: Email and password fields and labels plus create and login buttons
2. Welcome onboarding screen
3. Instructions onboarding screen
4. Shoe Listing screen
5. Shoe Detail screen for adding a new shoe

This is a project I have done myself for the Udacity Kotlin Nanodegree. I used view Model- Live data architecture to save data. I learnt about navigation using navgraphs, fragments, creating menu options, saving data in viewModel , creating responsive layouts and so much more
